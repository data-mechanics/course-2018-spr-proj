We use Boston Crime Incident Report to analyze the crime activities in the Boston area. By using the report time and incident areas from the data, we can know that which areas were safe and which areas have more activities. We will check crime activities such as stealing, robbery and drug report. We will also check the Fire Incident report. This data may tell us the condition of fire equipment in certain area. Then we will compare the data with Housing Value and Rental Listing. Housing Value and Rental Listing may imply the safe areas in Boston. We will compare the house value with the crime incidents and fire incidents in certain areas. We assume that the higher the housing value is, the safer the area is. Median neighborhood income will be used to compare with the Crime report later.

Crime Incident Report contains 260 thousand data. It will take a long time to run.
